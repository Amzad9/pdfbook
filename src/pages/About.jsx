      <p className="font-roboto mb-4">The compendium on adaptive water resources management
        practices in Sindh titled “Water Wisdom - Conserving Water for
        Pakistan’s Future” is a comprehensive collection of efforts to
        address the pressing water resources challenges faced by the
        second most populous province of Pakistan. This initiative aligns
        with the Sindh Water Policy 2023 and emphasises the critical
        need for innovative and adaptive water management strategies
        to ensure the region’s sustainable development and well-being.
        The significant contributions of the Government of Sindh, various
        provincial and federal departments, and local stakeholders have
        enriched this compendium. </p>
      <p className="font-roboto">for policymakers, water resources managers, and agricultural
        extension workers. By adopting and scaling up the identified
        best practices, Sindh can move towards more efficient water
        use, improved agricultural productivity, and enhanced resilience
        to the adverse impacts of climate change. The compendium
        also aims to raise awareness and sensitise decision-makers,
        service providers, and professionals, about the beneficial use of
        conventional and non-conventional water resources to mitigate
        the impacts of seasonal climatic variations on surface run-off,
        river flows, canal supplies, groundwater recharge, and discharges.
        The success of these adaptive practices will contribute to
        securing water availability for diverse demands, supporting
        environmental flows, and fostering economic growth and food
        security in Sindh, Pakistan. The compendium provides technical
        insights and inspires collective action towards climate change
        adaptation, building resilience of the water sector, and sustainable
        water resources management for the future prosperity of the
        province</p>
